Requirements

    Switch Case:
        Create a menu that allows users to choose one of the following actions:
            1: Format text (make upper or lower case).
            2: Check today's date and day of the week.
            3: Perform basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction) on two numbers.
            4: Exit the program.

    Date and Time:
        When the user selects option 2, display the current date and time, along with the day of the week.

    String Manipulation:
        For option 1, prompt the user to enter a string and a choice for:
            Convert to upper case
            Convert to lower case
        Display the result.

    Passing Numeric Input:
        For option 3, ask the user to enter two numbers and an operation (addition or subtraction).
        Display the result of the chosen arithmetic operation.

    Concatenation and Interpolation:
        Use concatenation and string interpolation to format your output, such as:
            "Today is [date]. It's a beautiful [day]."
            "The result of adding [number1] and [number2] is [result]."
