//Instructions:
//Objective: Design and implement a simple card game in C# using the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP).

//Requirements:

//Create a Card class to represent individual cards.
//Create a Deck class to manage a standard deck of 52 playing cards.
//Create a Player class to represent players in the game, each with their own hand of cards.
//Implement a CardGame class to handle the game logic, including shuffling the deck, dealing cards, and determining the winner.
//Write a Main program that allows users to:
//Enter the number of players and their names.
//Play the game and display results, including each playerâ€™s hand and the winner.
//Gameplay:

//We will bee using "High Card" as our game of choice:
//In "High Card", each player is dealt a single card, and the player with the highest card wins.
//Implement rules specific to the chosen game in the CardGame class.


//Enhancements(Optional):

//Allow replaying the game without restarting the program.
//Add support for multiple rounds or additional game rules.
//Include error handling for invalid inputs.
//Deliverables:

//A complete and well-documented C# project.
//Ensure that your code demonstrates OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance (if applicable), and abstraction.
//Provide comments explaining key parts of your code.
//Evaluation Criteria:

//Correct implementation of the game logic.
//Proper use of OOP principles.
//Code readability, including meaningful class and method names, proper indentation, and comments.
//Functionality and user experience.
